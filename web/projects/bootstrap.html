<p>This is a very simple (for now) script to set up a NEW UNMODIFIED Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL hereafter) with the following functionality :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated to the latest package versions from <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> upstream</li>
  <li>Have the build-essential package installed plus all required support libraries to enable the below functionality to work</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> Editor installed as standard with Package Control and a number of useful packages</li>
  <li>The Latest version of <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> installed. A skeleton .gitconfig will be set up with a few aliases</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> scripting language installed via <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">Rbenv</a> with the current version of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> installed as standard along with several other common gems</li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> - both the most recent LTS version and latest stable version via <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">NVM</a>. The LTS version is activated by default</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> scripting language both the latest 2.7 and 3.x versions via <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">Pyenv</a></li>
  <li>Install the latest STABLE a[https://www.perl.org/]{Perl} scripting language via <a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> with cpan and cpanm pre-installed and configured. Several PERL modules that make cpan easier are also pre-installed</li>
  <li>Enable resolution of WINS hostnames</li>
  <li>Install <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">GEdit</a> (Text editor) and <a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM">PCManFM</a> (file manager). Both can be run from the Bash shell using <span class="console-output">gedit</span> and <span class="console-output">pcmanfm</span> respectively</li>
</ul>

<p>Note since WSL is basically just a standard Ubuntu installation this script should also work unmodified on an Ubuntu Distribution, though currently untested.</p>
