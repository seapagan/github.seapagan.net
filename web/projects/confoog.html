<p class='important-note'>Note : While this Gem is fully functional, the API may be subject to changes before hitting version 1.0.0</p>
<p>This Gem allows your Ruby scripts and Gems to save and load their settings to a configuration file in YAML format.</p>
<p>At it's most basic :</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
require 'confoog'

settings = Confoog::Settings.new
settings[:var] = value
settings[:array] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
settings[42] = "Meaning of life"
settings[:urls] = ["https://www.mywebsite.com", "https://www.anothersite.com/a/page.html"]

settings[:urls].each do |url|
  puts url
end
# https://www.mywebsite.com
# https://www.anothersite.com/a/page.html
# => ["https://www.mywebsite.com", "https://www.anothersite.com/a/page.html"]

settings[:dont_exist]
# => nil

a_variable = 50
settings[a_variable] = {:one => "for the money", :two => "for the show", :three => "to get ready"}
settings[50]
# => {:one=>"for the money", :two=>"for the show", :three=>"to get ready"}
settings[50][:two]
# => "for the show"

settings.quiet = true # squelch any error or status messages to console

settings.autosave = false # disable autosave if it has been enabled with #new or #autosave

settings.save # save all current parameters to the YAML file

settings.load # load the settings from YAML file.
</code></pre>
<p>This Gem is used extensively in my 'Update_repo' Project and has performed flawlessly and with minimal configuration.</p>
